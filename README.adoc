= `nixlab`
My homelab/network configuration, primarily using NixOS flakes for deployment.

== Network Anatomy
=== Services
* WIP `squeeze`: Runs basically all of my self hosted services
** Runs as a VM on my proxmox instance on my Dell Poweredge T420
** Should start automatically when proxmox boots up
** Hosts my file share, which is served either through nextcloud or sshfs
** Additionally hosts
* TODO ``: My development server
** Serves as a machine I can SSH into to work on projects in case im on a system that doesn't allow installing stuff
* TODO ``: Entirely focused on my 3d printer
** If started, runs Klipper for my Voxelab Aquila

=== Automation
* WIP ``: Manages networking
** Oracle Free Tier compute instance
** Hosts headscale for my VPN, as well as nginx reverse proxy and duckdns
* TODO ``: Primary automation machine
** Runs as a VM on my proxmox instance on my Dell Poweredge T420
** Hosts n8n as well as other AI agents
* TODO ``: Automation machine when ``
** Serves n8n when `` is down, then

=== Clients
* My phones and laptops
* Should just be running tailscale, syncthing, and either sshfs or nextcloud to access my file share

== Wishlist
* Either NVIDIA teslas and a new PSU for my T420 or a seperate machine dedicated for AI agents
* Maybe a NAS that I can migrate my services to and have the T420 act as a Promox backup server
* A Raspberry Pi 5 or similar to run automation when `` is down
** Could just be something that can run really small AI agents and uses very little power
** Currently using a Raspberry Pi 3, which leaves a lot to be desired
