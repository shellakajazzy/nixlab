= `nixlab`
This repo contains the design documents, configurations, and deployment setup for my homelab.

== Anatomy
=== Physical Machines
* Dell PowerEdge T420
* Raspberry Pi 3

=== Hosts
==== VLANs
Unless otherwise specified, all machines are running as NixOS VMs running on Proxmox on the T420.
Additionlly, all machines are clients on my Tailnet, but access between machines should be limited using Tailscale ACL rules.
VLAN segmentation is achieved using a Proxmox VLAN SDN Zone.

* Home Network
** `proxmox` Proxmox on Poweredge T420
** `raspbian` Raspbian on Raspberry Pi 3
*** Dedicated wake-on-lan server for my T420, which is not always powered on
* User VLAN - Internal services
** `internal` Tailscale serve server
*** Only powered on when the other machines in this VLAN are powered on
** `filesharing` Nextcloud + Syncthing
** `jellyfin` Jellyfin
** `automation` n8n + AI agents
*** GPU is passed through for use for AIs
* DMZ VLAN - Public (internet) facing services
** `shellakajazzy` Tailscale tunnel server
** `forgejo` Forgejo
** `web` Blog / personal website
