= `nixlab`
My homelab/network configuration, primarily using NixOS flakes for deployment.

== Network Anatomy
* Using tailscale as a meshnet VPN to connect all of my machines together, as well as funneling some services to the public internet

* `summon`: Development and deployment server
** Has read/write access to this GitHub repo
** Uses nixos-anywhere to deploy my NixOS machines

=== Services
* `squeeze`: Runs basically all of my self hosted services
** Runs as a VM on my Proxmox instance on my Dell Poweredge T420
** Should start automatically when proxmox boots up
** Hosts my file share, which is served either through nextcloud or sshfs
** Runs most of my self-hosted services

=== Automation
* `spitball`: Dedicated n8n server
** VM on my Proxmox instance of my T420
** Running local AI agents through Ollama
* `slumber`: Dedicated wake-on-Lan server
** Running on a Raspberry Pi 3
*** Host OS is Raspbian Lite instead of NixOS due to difficulty of setting up nixos-anywhere with a Pi 3
** Automates waking my T420

=== Clients
* My phones and laptops
* Should just be running tailscale, syncthing, and either sshfs or nextcloud to access my file share
* Might allow laptop to deploy my machines using nixos-anywhere
